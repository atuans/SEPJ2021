# SEPJ2021
Software Engineer course final project
Our demo video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq3xaibAdB0&ab_channel=AnhTu%E1%BA%A5n
I use eclipse
So the BEAN, Controller, DAO and DB are located in src/main/java, remember to change your profile in DBConnect file ( username, password)
All the rest file is located in the WebContent folder

This project is still not completed ! 
Some function, button I still not use and don't finished yet, but i will try to add them in the future :) 
The reason i'm use JSP instead of Spring or another framework because i would like to learn the concrete first !
Enjoy !
